# H2O-model
These are a couple of Python programs written to determine the total non-bonding energy of two water molecules. This resultant energy is the sum of all the electrostatic contributions and the Lennard-Jones potential between the two oxygen atoms.

Go to the **'Ordinary Configuration'** folder to find the script in which you can calculate the total energy at different separations when all hydrogen atoms are pointing to the left.

In the folder named 'Inverted Configuration,' you will find a script that performs the same calculations but in a configuration where the pair of hydrogen atoms from one molecule is pointing in the opposite direction compared to the hydrogen atoms of the other molecule. There are two ways to arrange this configuration: with hydrogens facing inward toward the center of mass and with hydrogens facing outward from it.
